# Fine_Tune_Your_Own_Llama_2_Model
**Fine-Tuning Llama 2 (7 billion parameters) with VRAM Limitations and QLoRA:**

In this section, the goal is to fine-tune a Llama 2 model with 7 billion parameters using a T4 GPU with 16 GB of VRAM. Given the VRAM limitations, traditional fine-tuning is not feasible, necessitating parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA or QLoRA. The chosen approach is QLoRA, which employs 4-bit precision to drastically reduce VRAM usage.

The following steps will be executed:

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - The task involves leveraging the Hugging Face ecosystem and several libraries: transformers, accelerate, peft, trl, and bitsandbytes.

2. **Installation and Library Loading:**
   - The first step is to install and load the required libraries, as provided by Younes Belkada's GitHub Gist.

(Note: T4 GPU has 16 GB VRAM, 7 billion parameters of Llama 2 in 4-bit precision consume around 14 GB in FP16, and PEFT techniques like QLoRA are employed for efficient fine-tuning.)
